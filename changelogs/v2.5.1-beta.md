This patch release addresses various bugs, including critical issues, and introduces some improvements for a smoother user experience.

## Fixes

- Resolved a crash caused by invalid screen states ([#1109](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1109)).
- Fixed an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` occurring in `MultiLogSenderHandler` ([#1110](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1110)).

## Improvements

- Enhanced syntax highlighting for Java and Kotlin languages ([#1051](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1051)).
- Custom color schemes now fallback to the default color scheme for screens that do not specify colors for a specific file or type.
