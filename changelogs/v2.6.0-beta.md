# AndroidIDE Version 2.6.0-beta Changelog

This minor release fixes bugs while adding some necessary features and improvements.

Thanks to all the people who have contributed to this release (including our [Crowdin translators](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/blob/dev/CROWDIN_CONTRIBUTORS.md)).

## Important Note

- We have new GitHub sponsors!
  - [@Meisterqn](https://github.com/Meisterqn)
  - [@esalessandrxx](https://github.com/esalessandrxx)
- The AndroidIDE project is now supported by [DigitalOcean Open Source Sponsorship](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/credits-for-projects) program.

## Additions

- You can now select the build variant for each Android module in the project ([#223](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/223)).
- Multiple application modules (`com.android.application`) in a project are now supported.
- Support for static span colors has been added, allowing previewing the HEX colors in XML/Java/Kotlin files. If you have created a custom color scheme, you need to update your scheme according to [this commit](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/commit/ce4295b63e03e1506daad2f4cfd4b2a5c902d53c) (see the language scheme files) in order to enable this feature.
- Android Gradle Plugin v8.2.x is now supported.
- New actions:
  - `Disconnect logsenders`: Disconnects from all connected log senders at once.
  - `Long select` (editor text action): Allows selecting long text efficiently without using the selection handle.
  - `Launch app`: Launches the already installed application.
- New preferences:
  - Preference to choose AndroidIDE's theme (requires restart if changed) :
    - Blue wave - new default theme
    - Sunny glow - the previous (yellowish) theme
    - Material You
  - Preference to choose language for AndroidIDE. Per-app language support has been added for Android 13+ devices.
  - Preference to enable/disable sticky scroll in the editor (disabled by default).
  - Preference to automatically launch application after build & install (disabled by default).
  - Preference to enable/disable line number pinning in editor (enabled by default).
  - Preferences to enable/disable log receiver service (enabled by default).
