# AndroidIDE Version 2.5.3-beta Changelog

In this release of AndroidIDE v2.5.3-beta, we've taken steps to address a variety of issues, including critical ones.

## Bug Fixes

We've successfully resolved the following issues:

- Fixed an issue where a `SocketException` would be logged even if the socket was manually closed, resulting in misleading logs appearing in the IDE logs ([#1183](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1183)).
- Resolved a memory leak that was caused by the log line consumer not being properly released when the `LogSenderHandler` is closed.
- Addressed a problem where the UI designer consistently crashed when attempting to edit the inflated layout ([#1189](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1189)).
- Fixed a crash that occurred when the workspace fragment in the UI designer was being destroyed ([#1186](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1186)).
- Corrected an implementation issue in `RecyclerViewFragment.isEmpty()` that was preventing diagnostics and search results from being displayed.
- Disabled view binding for the Jetpack Compose template ([#1196](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1196)), thanks to @Rafael2616.
- Addressed a situation where the `LogSender` dependency introduced a transitive dependency to AndroidX's `ViewBinding` library ([#1199](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1199)).

## Enhancements

We've also made the following improvements to enhance your experience:

- Updated translations from Crowdin. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all the [Crowdin translators](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/blob/dev/CROWDIN_CONTRIBUTORS.md) for their invaluable contributions.

It's important to note that while this release might not feature major changes to the application's functionality, it does include critical bug fixes that significantly improve the application's stability and reliability.
