# AndroidIDE Version v2.7.1-beta Changelog

This patch release primarily focuses on making AndroidIDE available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.itsaky.androidide/) and includes some minor fixes.

Thanks to all the people who have contributed to this release (including our [Crowdin translators](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/blob/dev/CROWDIN_CONTRIBUTORS.md)).

## Important notes

- AndroidIDE is now accessible on F-Droid! Please be aware that F-Droid builds have a distinct signature. Installing these builds over existing GitHub versions or vice versa will result in installation failure.

## Additions

- Users with multiple JDKs can now select the JDK for Gradle builds in IDE Preferences -> Build & Run -> JDK version. Changes take effect after restarting AndroidIDE.

## Removals

- The `$PREFIX/etc/ide-environment.properties` file is no longer used for setting environment variables in Gradle builds or the terminal.

## Bug fixes

This release addresses the following issues:

- Resolved a bug causing the 'Clone repository' feature to consistently fail ([#1608](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1608)).
- Fixed occasional `NullPointerException` during the creation of `ActionData` for editor text actions.
- Resolved an `IllegalStateException` occurring when the build finishes after the activity is destroyed ([#1604](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1604)).
- Corrected the use of an invalid publishing version name for Gradle Plugin and LogSender dependencies in F-Droid builds ([#1620](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1620)).
- Fixed the issue where the IDE failed to recognize the installed JDK 21 ([#1616](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1616)).
- Addressed occasional crashes when putting the IDE in the background due to non-existing `openedFiles.json` file ([#1621](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1621)).
- Fixed incorrect display of project synchronization message when executing 'Sync project' action with unsaved Gradle files ([#1594](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1594)).
- Resolved build failure caused by `apply plugin: '...'` syntax in Gradle build scripts with a 'no repositories are defined' error ([#1274](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1274)).
- 'Cancel build' action now properly cancels project initialization.
- Set `android:foregroundServiceType` for `LogSenderService` to prevent crashes when targeting API 34.
- Resolved inconsistent behavior caused by a duplicate preference key in keyboard-related terminal preferences ([#1624](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/issues/1624)).
