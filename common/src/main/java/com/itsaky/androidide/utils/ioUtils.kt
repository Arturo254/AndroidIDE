/**
 * Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
 * given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
 * input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
 * stream.
 *
 * This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
 * writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
 * and/or output stream is _asynchronously closed_, or the thread
 * interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
 * specific, and therefore not specified.
 *
 * If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
 * output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
 * written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
 * one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
 * recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.
 *
 * @param  output the output stream, non-null
 * @return the number of bytes transferred
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
